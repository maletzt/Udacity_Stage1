			 				<ul> <!-- this tag creates and unordered list -->
				 				<li>The web is a collection of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) documents</li>
								<li>HTML is made up of text content, and reference other documents, and link to other pages</li>
								<li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the "style" of HTML Elements</li>
								<li>Three approaches to incorporating CSS:</li>
									<li>
										<ul>
											<li>Method 1: write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML</li>
											<li>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file</li>
											<li>Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

		 				<div class="content">
		 					<p>The web is composed largely of HTML documents. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Languageand is the language the browsers use to interpret web pages. The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers. The client and servers interact through something called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>
        					<p>HTML Elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content in a web page. Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.</p>
        					<p>	Taken from the <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/35695590050923">Udacity</a> website "New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts. But programming doesn't work like that! There's just too many facts to remember them all. Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them." So you can always do a google search to find help, like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> to refresh your memory.</p>

		 				<div class="content">
		 					<p> <b>Search and Replace</b> - You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find (or match, in CSS terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different ones.</p>
        					<p><b>Order Matters</b> - It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions.</p>
        					<p><b>Specifics Matter</b> - "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.</p>
